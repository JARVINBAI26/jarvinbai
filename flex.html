<h2>self respect movement</h2>
<div>
<p>
 The Self-Respect Movement is a South Asian movement with the aim
 of achieving a society in which backward castes have equal human rights,
 [1] and encouraging backward castes to have self-respect in the context 
 of a caste-based society that considered them to be a lower end of the hierarchy.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was founded in 1925 by S. Ramanathan[3] who invited E. V. Ramasamy
  (also known as Periyar by his followers) to head the movement in Tamil Nadu
  India against Brahminism. The movement was extremely influential not just
  in Tamil Nadu, but also overseas in countries with large Tamil populations,
  such as Malaysia and Singapore.

  <p style="border-right-width:0px;">
  Among Singapore Indians, groups like the Tamil
  Reform Association, and leaders such as Thamizhavel G. Sarangapani were prominent 
  in promoting the principles of the
  Self-Respect Movement among the local Tamil population through schools and publications
